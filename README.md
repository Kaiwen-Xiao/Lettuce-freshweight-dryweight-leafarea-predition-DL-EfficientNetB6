# Lettuce-freshweight-dryweight-leafarea-predition-DL-EfficientNetB6
A simple implementation for a course project. The topic is to predict the fresh weight, dry weight, and leaf area with EfficientNet B7 to advance production in controlled environments such as greenhouses and vertical farms.  
The image dataset and ground truth download link is here: https://library.wur.nl/WebQuery/wurpubs/586469  Be advised, the RGB_277/309/322.png are missing, so are Depth_277/309/322.png
To run this code, you need:
1. The source code (project.py)
